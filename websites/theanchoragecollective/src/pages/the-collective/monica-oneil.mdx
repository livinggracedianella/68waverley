Monica is a Supervisor Trainer with The Anchorage Collective, faculty member of Morling College and Lead Pastor with Living Grace Dianella.

Monica is the founder of The Anchorage Collective.

She is an ordained minister with Churches of Christ and has 35 years experience working with people in church, not for profit, and education.
She has pastored in rural and city churches, church planted and been on team in a mega church. She began supervising in 2004. In 2007 she joined Vose Seminary to launch Vose Leadership, a professional development centre focussed on resourcing Christian leaders for a lifetime of healthy service. This had a natural synergy with the Field Education program at Vose (now Morling), which she has coordinated from 2009. Until the start of 2017 Monica oversaw the development of the Seminaryâ€™s RTO, offering Vocational Training to augment the training needs of churches and not for profit agencies. Monica trains and oversees a team of pastoral supervisors in her Morling College role.

Monica is married to Michael and they have three adult children and five grandsons. She is looking for some new hobbies so suggestions are welcome.
